# pyBoost
## Problem Statement
---
We build an algorithm with a python pacakge where all the functions are pre-defined and the end user only needs to include that library to use all the pre-defined functions by calling them. For example, we make an algorithm to create a library for mergesort in such a way that the end user can see the output or sorted array by direct defining the library along with the given unsorted array.
